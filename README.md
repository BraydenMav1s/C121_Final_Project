# Calorie Tracker/BMR

# Algorithm 

### BMR Calculation Algorithm

- Prompt user for gender, weight (kg), height (cm), and age.
- Apply BMR formula:
- Men: BMR = 88.36 + (13.4 * weight) + (4.8 * height) - (5.7 * age)
- Women: BMR = 447.6 + (9.2 * weight) + (3.1 * height) - (4.3 * age)
- Multiply BMR by activity level factor.
- Display daily calorie needs.

### Meal Logging Algorithm

- Prompt user to enter meal name and calorie count.
- Store meal in an ArrayList.
- Update daily total calorie count.
- Allow user to view calorie history.

### History & Analysis Algorithm

- Retrieve stored meal data.
- Display calories consumed per day.
- Provide feedback if consumption is above or below target.
